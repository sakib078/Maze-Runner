# Maze-Runner
Maze Runner is a command-based game that uses the concept of data structure and algorithms to suggest to the player new coordinates to reach to the exit while avoiding the obstacles that gonna be generated randomly and spread through the 2D map. Also, once the graphics gonna be added then looks very cool.
